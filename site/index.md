## What is neuroAI?

NeuroAI is the evolving intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Imagine a machine that can see just like a human. This allows us to improve everything from advertising to generative art. Anything that is meant for the human eye, we can make better. We help build a neuroAI strategy for your org.
